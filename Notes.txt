What is Javascript?
* JS is a light-weight, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language.
* JS is one of the 3 core technologies of web development.

Course Outline 
* JS Basics
  * Variables are used to store some data for later use. In other words, think of them as containers which hold whateve data you put inside them.
  * Operators are symbols used to perform some actions on variables.
  * Expression is a line of code which contains a valid combination of variables, values and Operators.
  * Data type tells JS what type of value we have stored in our variables.

* JS Variables
   * Camel Case
   * Pascal Case
   * Snake Case
* In-built Number functions
   * toString() : number as input and returns a string.
   * parseInt() : takes string numeral as input and returns a number.(This will return only integer number whole number not float)
   * parseFloat() : takes string numeral as input and returns a floating number.
   * toFixed() : takes a floating number and rounds it off to given position.

* In-built String functions
 * .length : returns the length of the string
 * indexOf() : Find indexOf a string inside another string
 * lastIndexOf() : find Last index of a string inside another string 
 * slice(start, end) : get a part of our string.
 * substr(startPos, length) : get sub string function
 * toUpperCase() : It converts our string -> toUpperCase characters.
 * toLowerCase() : It converts our string - > lowerCase
 * concat() : It merges two or more strings.(we can also use "+" to concat strings)
 * trim() : It removes extra spaces.
 * charAt() : It takes a position as an arg and returns the character at that position.
 * split() : it splits our string on the basis of the arguments passed.(gives array of elemnents)

Type coercion Implicit 
this converts the string number to number (+"2")
Explicit type coercion is conversion of datatype by programme()

* Objects and arrays
* Functions in JS
* Scope and environment
  * The scope defines the part of the program where a variable or a function is visible /accessible. 
  * The variable defined outside all the functions and blocks are available throughout the code. These are call global variables.
  * The variables defined inside the functions or blocks are local variables and are only availbale in that function or block of code. These variable are call Local variables.

* Variable Hoisting
  * The mechanism where variables and functions can be used before declaring them is called Hoisting in JS.
* Function Hoisting

* DOM & BOM
 * DOM
  * When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a DOM of the page. It is the tree representation of the HTML document. this DOM tree can be modified with teh help of JS.
   + Methods to select HTML elemnents
    * getElementByID
    * getElementByClassName
    * getElementByTagName
   + Query Selectors
    - Query Selectors allow you to use CSS selectors to select HTML elemnents. It is the new way in JS to select HTML elements.
    * querySelector()
    * querySelectorAll()
  * Update HTML elements
    
* Event Handling
* OOPs in JS
* AJAX & JSON
* Error Handling
* JQuery
* ES5 & ES6
